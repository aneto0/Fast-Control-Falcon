# Falcon Fast Data Acquisition

The Falcon *Fast Data Acquisition* acquires and stores data from an NI PXIe-6368 based system into an MDSplus pulse file (see \[F3.2.2\] in the [Falcon-Data-Storage](https://vcis-gitlab.f4e.europa.eu/aneto/Data-Storage-Falcon)).

## Functions

The main functions of the Falcon *Fast Data Acquisition* are to:

* \[F3.2.2.1\] Acquire data from 16 ADC channels of an NI PXIe-6368 board (at 2 MHz);
* \[F3.2.2.2\] Downsample this data to 1 kHz and store it on MDSplus database against a given pulse number (pulse number be managed by the [Falcon-Data-Storage](https://vcis-gitlab.f4e.europa.eu/aneto/Data-Storage-Falcon));
* \[F3.2.2.3\] Generate a 1 kHz time base that is unique in the falcon plant (so that the [PON Sampler](https://vcis-gitlab.f4e.europa.eu/aneto/PON-Sampler-Falcon) data can be correlated against the fast data acquisition data);
* \[F3.2.2.4\] Store ADC data at 2 MHz in the MDSplus database, during limited time-windows, when triggered by a digital input of the NI PXIe-6368 board;
* \[F3.2.2.5\] Detect and store in the MDSplus database the time at which the experiment was started. This detection is performed by monitoring one of the ADC channels against a configurable threshold. No data shall be stored before this event is detected;
* \[F3.2.2.6\] Store CRIO events received through UART in the MDSplus database, when triggered by one of the received events;
* \[F3.2.2.7\] Request CRIO to enable power supply through digital signals generated by the NI PXIe-6368 board. The request will be configured through EPICS CA variables, and triggered by a digital signal from the NI PXIe-6368 board;
* \[F3.2.2.8\] Receive commands through SDN:
  * **CommandMakeReady**: controls Application State Machine
  * **CommandLoad**: loads power supply configuration (mode, gyrotron, and pulse duration)
  * **CommandStopPower**: stops requesting power supply
  * **CommandPutManualPower**: requests power supply if in Manual Mode
  * **CommandSuspend**: temporarily stops/resumes power supply procedure
  * **CommandAbort**: terminates power supply procedure and disables it until Application State Machine goes to Online state
* \[F3.2.2.9\] Publish current Application State on SDN;

| --- | ----- | ----- |
| INITIAL | OFFPULSE | Starts the MARTe2 internal services. |
| OFFPULSE | READY | - Opens the MDSplus tree; <br/> - Changes the RealTimeApplication to the Ready state (see below); <br/> - Publish change to Ready state on SDN. <br/><br/> **Any error on the above will cause the state machine to go the ERROR state**.|
| READY | ONLINE | - Changes the RealTimeApplication to the Online state (see below); <br/>  - Sets TEST-AUX-FDAQ:Fast_Status to 1; <br/> - Publish change to Online state on SDN. <br/><br/> **Any error on the above will cause the state machine to go the ERROR state**.|
| READY | OFFPULSE | - Flushes the MDSplus tree with the latest acquired values; <br/> - Changes the RealTimeApplication to the Offpulse state (see below); <br/> - Sets TEST-AUX-FDAQ:Fast_Status to 0; <br/> - Sets TEST-AUX-FDAQ:Error_Status to 0; <br/> - Publish change to Offpulse state on SDN. <br/><br/> **Any error on the above will cause the state machine to go the ERROR state**.|
| ONLINE | OFFPULSE | - Flushes the MDSplus tree with the latest acquired values; <br/> - Changes the RealTimeApplication to the Offpulse state (see below); <br/> - Sets TEST-AUX-FDAQ:Fast_Status to 0; <br/> - Sets TEST-AUX-FDAQ:Error_Status to 0; <br/> - Publish change to Offpulse state on SDN. <br/><br/> **Any error on the above will cause the state machine to go the ERROR state**.|
| * | FAULT | - Changes the RealTimeApplication to the Fault state (ignoring any request to start an acquisition); <br/> - Sets TEST-AUX-FDAQ:Fast_Status to 0; <br/> - Sets TEST-AUX-FDAQ:Fast_Error to 1; <br/> - Publish change to Fault state on SDN. |
| FAULT | OFFPULSE | - Changes the RealTimeApplication to the Offpulse state (allowing to start an acquisition); <br/> - Sets TEST-AUX-FDAQ:Fast_Error to 0; <br/> - Publish change to Offpulse state on SDN. <br/>|


### RealTimeApplication 

The *Fast Data Acquisition* is implemented as a MARTe RealTimeApplication. 

The application allows for four real-time states:
* Fault: can be triggered by an internal error or by the StateMachine. In this state only the module that reads from the NI6368 data source is executed. 
* Offpulse: a module waits for 2000 samples to be ready from the NI6368 DataSource and makes it available to the following modules which will: i) get the latest digital input values from the  NI6368 DataSource; ii) transmit the cycle time to SDN; iii) downsample data to 1 kHz; iv) verify if a fast data acquisition trigger was requested by the digital inputs; and v) adjust the experiment time against the time at which the value of one of the ADC channels is greater than a given threshold (i.e. against the time of the start of the experiment). The two last modules have no real function in the *Offpulse* mode but were left to ease the debug of the application (using the BaseLib2GAM which allows to monitor these signals live).
* Ready: 
* Online: as the Ready state but also executes modules that store data in the MDSplus database.

**Note regarding time**

The time base is given by the NI6368 module and is computed as *t = k x CT*, where *CT* is the cycle time and *k* is the cycle number. The NI6368 module will trigger a new cycle when *N* samples are available (the value of *N* can be configured by the user), so that *CT = N / Fs*. The sampling frequency (Fs) is fixed to 2 MHz. The current version of the application uses *N=2000* so that the *CT = 1e-3 s*. The cycle number is reset upon state change, so that when the application enter in the *Acquiring* state its value is set to 0 and thus the time is set to 0. 

Given that this state change occurs before the real start of the experiment, the time base has to be corrected so that *t_c = t - t_s*, where *t_c* is the corrected time that will be stored in MDSplus and *t_s* is the time at which the experiment started. Until the experiment starts no data is stored in MDSplus. This is possible by inhibiting a triggering signal in the MDSWriter module.

The time of the start of the experiment is given by the time at which the value of ADC is greater than a given threshold (in reality an assert mechanism verifies that this condition is kept true for a given number of samples)  *t_s = t + z / Fs*, where *z* is the sample number where *ADC[z] > threshold* and *ADC* is the channel being monitored.

```
su
setup
```

Disable the following services:

* bluetooth
* ip6tables
* iptables
* postgresql-9.3

```

3. Reboot

### MDSplus

1. Log-in as *codac-dev* to the Fast Controller 1 server (10.136.50.30).
2. Install the [MDSplus alpha version](http://www.mdsplus.org/index.php/Latest_RPM%27s_and_Yum_repositories)
3. Install the mdsplus-alpha libraries
 
```
yum install mdsplus-alpha
yum install mdsplus-alpha-devel
yum install mdsplus-alpha-java
yum install mdsplus-alpha-kernel
yum install mdsplus-alpha-python
```
 
4. Edit the file /etc/mdsplus.conf and write:

```
falcon_path 10.136.30.21:8000::/raiddata/mdsplus/trees
falcon_conf_path 10.136.30.21:8000::/raiddata/mdsplus/trees
falcon_mon_path 10.136.30.21:8000::/raiddata/mdsplus/trees
falcon_fast_path 10.136.30.21:8000::/raiddata/mdsplus/trees
falcon_trend_path 10.136.30.21:8000::/raiddata/mdsplus/trees
```

**Note** it is assumed that the falcon_fast tree was created as described in the [Falcon-Data-Storage](https://vcis-gitlab.f4e.europa.eu/aneto/Data-Storage-Falcon) procedure.

## Maintenance

### Changing the MDSplus signal names

1- Change the signal names in MDSplus and regenerate the tree as described in the procedures of [Falcon-Data-Storage](https://vcis-gitlab.f4e.europa.eu/aneto/Data-Storage-Falcon). 

Note that the fast signal names are defined in the [CreateFalconMDSPlusFastTree.tcl file](https://vcis-gitlab.f4e.europa.eu/aneto/Data-Storage-Falcon/blob/master/Tools/CreateFalconMDSPlusFastTree.tcl). **Remember to commit and push any changes to this file!**


2- Copy the latest version of the Startup configuration file

```
cd ~/Projects/Fast-Control-Falcon/Configuration
cp Startup.cfg NewConfiguration.cfg
```

**Note:** the *NewConfiguration.cfg* can be any file name and **shall be commited and pushed to the vcis server**.

3- In the MDSWriter and MDSWriterSlow signals edit the *NodeName* fields accordingly to what was set in the [CreateFalconMDSPlusFastTree.tcl file](https://vcis-gitlab.f4e.europa.eu/aneto/Data-Storage-Falcon/blob/master/Tools/CreateFalconMDSPlusFastTree.tcl)

4- Create the link to the Startup file.

```
rm Startup.cfg
ln -s /home/codac-dev/Projects/Fast-Control-Falcon/Configuration/NewConfiguration.cfg /home/codac-dev/Projects/Fast-Control-Falcon/Configuration/Startup.cfg
``` 

5- Restart the service

```
su
/etc/init.d/MARTeService restart
exit 
```
